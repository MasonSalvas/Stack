# Stack
This shows the use of the stack data structure.

# Purposes:
Work with a stack data structure to implement a conversion of infix-notation to postfix-notation arithmetic expressions. Work with file I/O operations.

# Description:
This is a program that evaluates arithmetic expressions in infix notation. The program reads arithmetic expressions from an input file (expr.dat). The program converts an expression of each line to postfix notation and evaluates the postfix expression. The program then outputs the original infix expression and the equivalent postfix expression onto the screen.
