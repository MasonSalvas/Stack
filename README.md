# Stack
This shows the use of the stack data structure.

# Purposes:
Work with a stack data structure to implement a conversion of infix-notation to postfix-notation arithmetic expressions. Work with file I/O operations.

# Description:
Write a program that evaluates arithmetic expressions in infix notation. Your program should read arithmetic expressions from an input file (expr.dat). Your program converts an expression of each line to postfix notation and evaluates the postfix expression. Your program should output the original infix expression and the equivalent postfix expression onto the screen.
